# Smart-Room-Control

An IoT-based embedded project that automates home/room appliances (fans, lights) using sensors and microcontrollers. It detects human presence using ultrasonic sensors and optimizes energy consumption by switching devices on/off automatically.

Tech Stack (Hardware & Software):

Microcontroller: Arduino UNO / ESP8266

Sensors: Ultrasonic sensor, relay module

Programming: Embedded C

Communication: Serial/UART, Wi-Fi (if extended to IoT)

Optional: Mobile App (Blynk) for remote control
